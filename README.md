# Gesture-Audio-Control
This project enables real-time system volume control using hand gestures detected via a webcam. By leveraging OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for hand tracking, users can adjust their Mac's audio output volume by changing the distance between their thumb and index fingerâ€”providing a touchless, intuitive interface for audio control.
